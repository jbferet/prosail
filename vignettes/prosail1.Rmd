This tutorial briefly describes the different functionalities of the R package 
`prosail`, based on the canopy reflectance model __4SAIL__ coupled with the leaf 
model __PROSPECT__.
The package `prosail` includes the package `prospect`, so please check the brief 
tutorial from [this package](https://jbferet.gitlab.io/prospect/) if you need 
specific information on __PROSPECT__.

The current version of the model PROSPECT implemented in `prosail` is __PROSPECT-PRO__.

There are currently two versions of the model SAIL implemented in `prosail`: 
__4SAIL__ and __4SAIL2__. 

The SAIL model is an example of four-stream representations of the radiative 
transfer equation, in which case one distinguishes two direct fluxes (incident 
solar flux and radiance in the viewing direction) and two diffuse fluxes 
(upward and downward hemispherical flux). 
Detailed description of the functioning of the different SAIL versions can be 
found in [Verhoef & Bach, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2006.12.013) and 
[Verhoef et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2007.895844), from which the
figure below is borrowed.
