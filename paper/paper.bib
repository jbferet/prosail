ABSTRACT = {Upcoming satellite hyperspectral sensors require powerful and robust methodologies for making optimum use of the rich spectral data. This paper reviews the widely applied coupled PROSPECT and SAIL radiative transfer models (PROSAIL), regarding their suitability for the retrieval of biophysical and biochemical variables in the context of agricultural crop monitoring. Evaluation was carried out using a systematic literature review of 281 scientific publications with regard to their (i) spectral exploitation, (ii) vegetation type analyzed, (iii) variables retrieved, and (iv) choice of retrieval methods. From the analysis, current trends were derived, and problems identified and discussed. Our analysis clearly shows that the PROSAIL model is well suited for the analysis of imaging spectrometer data from future satellite missions and that the model should be integrated in appropriate software tools that are being developed in this context for agricultural applications. The review supports the decision of potential users to employ PROSAIL for their specific data analysis and provides guidelines for choosing between the diverse retrieval techniques.},

abstract = {Reflectance measurements from the spaceborne Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) instrument are used to analyze the so-called hot spot directional signature in the backscattering direction. The hot spot is measured with an angular resolution better than half a degree using the directional capabilities of the radiometer, with some assumptions on the spatial homogeneity of the surface. The analysis yields the first quantitative observation of the hot spot signature of vegetated surfaces, with such angular resolution. The measurements show that the hot spot reflectance is a function of the phase angle ξ rather than a function of a parameter Δ, often used in hot spot modeling, that quantifies the horizontal distance between Sun and view directions. The observed directional signature is very accurately fitted by a linear ratio of the phase angle, as predicted by a simple theory of radiative transfer within the canopy foliage. Most of the measured hot spot half widths are between 1° and 2°. Some dispersion occurs for the cases belonging to the forest and desert International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) classes, in the range 1° to 5°. Theory predicts that the width is independent of wavelength. Our measurements indicate that the widths at 670 and 865 nm are very close, but with a significant scatter in regards to the rather small variability. The distribution of the width as a function of the IGBP surface classification shows a variability within the classes that is larger than between the classes, except for the “evergreen broadleaf” class. The hot spot reflectance amplitude is generally on the order of 0.10–0.20 at 865 nm and 0.03–0.18 at 670 nm, although the full range of values is wider. For thick canopies, it may be interpreted in terms of foliage element (leaf) reflectance. Retrieved values are on the order of 0.4 in the near infrared and in the range 0.05–0.20 at 670 nm. At 440 nm, the amplitude of the signature is very small, as is expected from the small surface reflectance. This confirms that the atmospheric contribution to the reflectance increase at the backscattering direction is negligible.},

Measurement and model uncertainties make the inverse problem ill posed, inducing difficulties and inaccuracies in the search for the solution. This study focuses on the use of prior information to reduce the uncertainties associated to the estimation of canopy biophysical variables in the radiative transfer model inversion process. For this purpose, lookup table (LUT), quasi-Newton algorithm (QNT), and neural network (NNT) inversion techniques were adapted to account for prior information. Results were evaluated over simulated reflectance data sets that allow a detailed analysis of the effect of measurement and model uncertainties. Results demonstrate that the use of prior information significantly improves canopy biophysical variables estimation. LUT and QNT are sensitive to model uncertainties. Conversely, NNT techniques are generally less accurate. However, in our conditions, its accuracy is little dependent significantly on modeling or measurement error. We also observed that bias in the reflectance measurements due to miscalibration did not impact very much the accuracy of biophysical estimation.}

abstract = {Leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT) are key leaf functional traits providing information for many applications including ecosystem functioning modeling and fire risk management. In this paper, we investigate two common conclusions generally made for LMA and EWT estimation based on leaf optical properties in the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) domains: (1) physically-based approaches estimate EWT accurately and LMA poorly, while (2) statistically-based and machine learning (ML) methods provide accurate estimates of both LMA and EWT. Using six experimental datasets including broadleaf species samples of >150 species collected over tropical, temperate and boreal ecosystems, we compared the performances of a physically-based method (PROSPECT model inversion) and a ML algorithm (support vector machine regression, SVM) to infer EWT and LMA based on leaf reflectance and transmittance. We assessed several merit functions to invert PROSPECT based on iterative optimization and investigated the spectral domain to be used for optimal estimation of LMA and EWT. We also tested several strategies to select the training samples used by the SVM, in order to investigate the generalization ability of the derived regression models. We evidenced that using spectral information from 1700 to 2400 nm leads to strong improvement in the estimation of EWT and LMA when performing a PROSPECT inversion, decreasing the LMA and EWT estimation errors by 55% and 33%, respectively. The comparison of various sampling strategies for the training set used with SVM suggests that regression models show limited generalization ability, particularly when the regression model is applied on data fully independent from the training set. Finally, our results demonstrate that, when using an appropriate spectral domain, the PROSPECT inversion outperforms SVM trained with experimental data for the estimation of EWT and LMA. Thus we recommend that estimation of LMA and EWT based on leaf optical properties should be physically-based using inversion of reflectance and transmittance measurements on the 1700 to 2400 nm spectral range.}

ABSTRACT = {Satellite and airborne optical sensors are increasingly used by scientists, and policy makers, and managers for studying and managing forests, agriculture crops, and urban areas. Their data acquired with given instrumental specifications (spectral resolution, viewing direction, sensor field-of-view, etc.) and for a specific experimental configuration (surface and atmosphere conditions, sun direction, etc.) are commonly translated into qualitative and quantitative Earth surface parameters. However, atmosphere properties and Earth surface 3D architecture often confound their interpretation. Radiative transfer models capable of simulating the Earth and atmosphere complexity are, therefore, ideal tools for linking remotely sensed data to the surface parameters. Still, many existing models are oversimplifying the Earth-atmosphere system interactions and their parameterization of sensor specifications is often neglected or poorly considered. The Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model is one of the most comprehensive physically based 3D models simulating the Earth-atmosphere radiation interaction from visible to thermal infrared wavelengths. It has been developed since 1992. It models optical signals at the entrance of imaging radiometers and laser scanners on board of satellites and airplanes, as well as the 3D radiative budget, of urban and natural landscapes for any experimental configuration and instrumental specification. It is freely distributed for research and teaching activities. This paper presents DART physical bases and its latest functionality for simulating imaging spectroscopy of natural and urban landscapes with atmosphere, including the perspective projection of airborne acquisitions and LIght Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) waveform and photon counting signals.},

PROSAIL has also been used to develop new methods for retrieval of vegetation biophysical properties. It links the spectral variation of canopy reflectance, which is mainly related to leaf biochemical contents, with its directional variation, which is primarily related to canopy architecture and soil/vegetation contrast. This link is key to simultaneous estimation of canopy biophysical/structural variables for applications in agriculture, plant physiology, or ecology, at different scales. PROSAIL has become one of the most popular radiative transfer tools due to its ease of use, general robustness, and consistent validation by lab/field/space experiments over the years. However, PROSPECT and SAIL are still evolving: they have undergone recent improvements both at the leaf and the plant levels. This paper provides an extensive review of the PROSAIL developments in the context of canopy biophysics and radiative transfer modeling.}

With a change in the view direction we can see some of the shadows. Therefore, the mean radiance of reflection decreases.

abstract = {Abstract Spectroscopic reflectance data provide novel information on the properties of the Earth's terrestrial and aquatic surfaces. Until recently, imaging spectroscopy missions were dependent mainly on airborne instruments, such as the Next Generation Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG), providing limited spatial and temporal observations. Currently, there is an emergence of spaceborne imaging spectroscopy missions, which require advances in end-to-end model support for traceability studies. To provide this support, the LPJ-wsl dynamic global vegetation model is coupled with the canopy radiative transfer model, PROSAIL, to generate global, gridded, daily visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) spectra (400–2,500 nm). LPJ-wsl variables are cross-walked to meet required PROSAIL parameters, which include leaf structure, chlorophyll a + b, brown pigment, equivalent water thickness, and dry matter content. Simulated spectra are compared to a boreal forest site, a temperate forest, managed grassland, a dryland and a tropical forest site using reflectance data from tower-mounted, aircraft, and spaceborne imagers. We find that canopy nitrogen and leaf-area index are the most uncertain variables in translating LPJ-wsl to PROSAIL parameters but at first order, LPJ-PROSAIL successfully simulates surface reflectance dynamics. Future work will optimize functional relationships required for improving PROSAIL parameters and include the development of the LPJ-model to represent improvements in leaf water content and canopy nitrogen. The LPJ-PROSAIL model is intended to support missions such as NASA's Surface Biology and Geology and subsequent modeled products related to the carbon cycle and hydrology.},

abstract = {Leaf biochemical and structural traits are vegetation characteristics related to various physiological processes. Taking advantage of the physical relationship between optical properties and leaf biochemistry, field-based spectroscopy has allowed for the rapid estimation of leaf biochemical constituents and repeated non-destructive measurements through time. Leaf constituent retrieval from leaf optical properties following inversion of the physically-based radiative transfer model PROSPECT is now a popular method, but some cases prompt poor retrieval success and this approach requires a strict inversion procedure. We investigated the performances of different inversion procedures for the estimation of leaf constituents, specifically chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, water (EWT), and dry matter (LMA) from >1400 broadleaf samples, including the definition of optimal spectral subdomains, and the use of leaf reflectance or transmittance alone. We also developed a strategy to obtain prior information on the leaf structure parameter (N) in PROSPECT, when only reflectance or transmittance is measured, and examined the influence of this prior information in combination with different inversion procedures. We found that using the full domain of reflectance or transmittance only systematically leads to suboptimal estimation of chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, EWT, and LMA, due to either the combined absorption of multiple constituents or inaccurate estimation of the N parameter. Our study confirms that the selection of optimal spectral subdomains leads to improved estimation of all leaf constituents, from 700 to 720 nm for chlorophyll a and b, 520–560 nm for carotenoids, and from 1700 to 2400 nm for EWT and LMA. Prior information on N, computed directly from the spectra, leads to systematic improved estimation of leaf constituents when only reflectance or transmittance is measured, with reductions in normalized root mean square error from 8 to 37%. We strongly recommend using optimal subdomains when inverting PROSPECT to retrieve leaf constituents, and with the availability of only reflectance or transmittance we further recommend the use of prior information on the N parameter.}

abstract = {In modeling canopy photosynthesis, it is important to discriminate between the direct and diffuse components of incoming, global radiation. An equation is presented to estimate the share of both components from the measured daily global irradiance only. In this equation the share of the diffuse component is related to the ratio between global and extra-terrestrial radiation. This relation is based on a summary of literature data and of radiation measurements in The Netherlands. The diurnal trends of global, direct and diffuse radiation were derived from a sinusoid with a correction depending on solar angle. The random variation around this sine wave is characterized. For clear skies about 15% of the diffuse flux comes predominantly from directions near the sun and this circumsolar component has to be added to the direct flux. On the other hand, for clear skies the diffuse fraction in the photosynthetically active wave bands is about 40% larger than that for the total global radiation. In the past, the partitioning between direct and diffuse radiation was tackled by assuming that short periods of either fully clear or overcast conditions alternate within the day. That approach severely underestimated the share of the diffuse component in the total global radiation. The method presented in this paper is particularly useful for application in crop growth models.}

abstract = {Coupling radiative transfer models for the soil background and vegetation canopy layers is facilitated by means of the four-stream flux interaction concept and use of the adding method. Also the coupling to a state-of-the-art atmospheric radiative transfer model like MODTRAN4 can be established in this way, thus enabling the realistic simulation of top-of-atmosphere radiances detected by space-borne remote sensing instruments. Possible applications of coupled modeling vary from mission design to parameter retrieval and data assimilation. This paper introduces a modified Hapke soil BRDF model, a robust version of the PROSPECT leaf model, and a modernized canopy radiative transfer model called 4SAIL2. The latter is a hybrid two-layer version of SAIL accommodating horizontal and vertical heterogeneities, featuring improved modeling of the hot spot effect and output of canopy absorptances. The integrated model is simply called SLC (soil–leaf-canopy) and has been implemented as a speed-optimized Windows DLL which allows efficient use of computer resources even when simulating massive amounts of hyperspectral multi-angular observations. In this paper various examples of possible model output are shown, including simulated satellite image products. First validation results have been obtained from atmospherically corrected hyperspectral multi-angular CHRIS-PROBA data of the Upper Rhine Valley in Germany.}

abstract = {Forthcoming superspectral satellite missions dedicated to land monitoring, as well as planned imaging spectrometers, will unleash an unprecedented data stream. The processing requirements for such large data streams involve processing techniques enabling the spatio-temporally explicit quantification of vegetation properties. Typically retrieval must be accurate, robust and fast. Hence, there is a strict requirement to identify next-generation bio-geophysical variable retrieval algorithms which can be molded into an operational processing chain. This paper offers a review of state-of-the-art retrieval methods for quantitative terrestrial bio-geophysical variable extraction using optical remote sensing imagery. We can categorize these methods into (1) parametric regression, (2) non-parametric regression, (3) physically-based and (4) hybrid methods. Hybrid methods combine generic capabilities of physically-based methods with flexible and computationally efficient methods, typically non-parametric regression methods. A review of the theoretical basis of all these methods is given first and followed by published applications. This paper focusses on: (1) retrievability of bio-geophysical variables, (2) ability to generate multiple outputs, (3) possibilities for model transparency description, (4) mapping speed, and (5) possibilities for uncertainty retrieval. Finally, the prospects of implementing these methods into future processing chains for operational retrieval of vegetation properties are presented and discussed.}
