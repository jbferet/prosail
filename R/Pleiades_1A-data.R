#' Spectral response function (SRF) for Pleiades-1A
#'
#' @format A list including
#'  - *spectral_response*: the SRF of each spectral band of the sensor for a
#'  spectral domain compatible with PROSAIL
#'  - *spectral_bands*: the spectral bands of the sensor (i.e. wavelength or
#'  name of the band as character)
#'  - *original_bands*: original spectral bands for which SRF is defined
#'  (compatible with PROSAIL == 1 nm spectral sampling)
#'  - *central_wl*: Central wavelength (in nm) of the sensor spectral bands
"Pleiades_1A"
